This folder contains code that I have developed to analyze data from sports I like watching such as Formula 1.

In the f1_data_race, all the lap times, tyre information and additional resources are downloaded from official 
sources. It is important for you to know that some errors might arise due to the API which is implemented in f1dataR
package.
